# Containerization & Deployment - Backend-AI Planning

## Introduction
Containerization and deployment are critical for ensuring that StravaAIâ€™s backend and AI services are portable, reproducible, and easy to manage across environments. The system should leverage Docker and Docker Compose for local development and production deployment, supporting rapid iteration and scalability for the Pre-MVP phase.

## Strategy

### Implementation Options
1. **Single Dockerfile per Service (Recommended for Pre-MVP)**
   - Create a Dockerfile for the backend (FastAPI) and another for the frontend.
   - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate backend, frontend, and MongoDB services.
   - Pros: Simple, fast to set up, easy for small teams.
   - Cons: Less granular scaling, but sufficient for Pre-MVP.

2. **Multi-Stage Docker Builds**
   - Use multi-stage builds to optimize image size and security.
   - Pros: Smaller images, better security.
   - Cons: Slightly more complex Dockerfile.

3. **Kubernetes or Cloud-Native Deployment**
   - Use Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.
   - Pros: Highly scalable, robust.
   - Cons: Overkill for Pre-MVP, more setup and cost.

### Recommended MVP Approach
- Use a single Dockerfile for the backend and frontend, orchestrated with Docker Compose.
- Include MongoDB as a service in Docker Compose for local development.
- Use environment variables for configuration (API keys, DB URIs, etc.).
- Prepare for easy migration to cloud hosting (VPS, managed DB) post-MVP.
- Document the containerization and deployment process for the team.

## Executive Checklist

- [ ] Create Dockerfile for frontend (React/Next.js)
- [ ] Write docker-compose.yml to orchestrate backend, frontend, and MongoDB
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration
- [ ] Test local development and production builds
- [ ] Document build, run, and deployment steps
- [ ] Prepare for cloud deployment (VPS, managed MongoDB)
