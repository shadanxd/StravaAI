# AI Insights Generation - Backend-AI Planning

## Introduction
AI Insights Generation is the core differentiator for StravaAI, providing users with personalized, context-aware recommendations and performance analysis. The backend must integrate with OpenAI GPT-4o or Gemini 2.5 Lite, generate insights based on user activity and profile data, and store these insights for user review and analytics. The system should be cost-effective, secure, and extensible for future AI models.

## Strategy

### Implementation Options
1. **Direct API Integration (Recommended for Pre-MVP)**
   - Call OpenAI/Gemini APIs directly from FastAPI endpoints when an insight is requested.
   - Store generated insights in the `insights` collection.
   - Pros: Simple, fast to implement, real-time insights.
   - Cons: Higher API costs, potential latency.

2. **Batch/Background Insight Generation**
   - Use background jobs to periodically generate insights for all users/activities.
   - Pros: Lower perceived latency for users, can optimize API usage.
   - Cons: Insights may be less timely, more complex scheduling.

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Generate some insights on-demand, others in batch/background.
   - Pros: Balances freshness and cost, but adds complexity.

### Recommended MVP Approach
- Use direct API integration for on-demand insight generation via `/api/insights/generate` endpoint.
- Store all generated insights in the `insights` collection, including context and AI model metadata.
- Monitor API usage and costs; implement fallback responses if API quota is exceeded.
- Ensure secure handling of API keys and user data.
- Design for easy extension to batch/background generation in the future.

## Executive Checklist
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI GPT-4o or Gemini 2.5 Lite API for insight generation
- [ ] Implement `/api/insights/generate` endpoint (on-demand insights)
- [ ] Store insights in MongoDB `insights` collection (with context, model info)
- [ ] Implement `/api/insights/history` and `/api/insights/{insight_id}` endpoints
- [ ] Monitor and log API usage and costs
- [ ] Implement fallback responses for API errors/quota limits
- [ ] Securely manage AI API keys and user data
- [ ] Document insight generation flow and data model
