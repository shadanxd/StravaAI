# Strava OAuth Authentication - Backend-AI Planning

## Introduction
Strava OAuth Authentication is the entry point for all users of StravaAI. It enables secure login using Strava accounts, allowing the application to fetch user activity data and provide personalized analytics and AI-powered insights. This system must handle user authorization, token management (including refresh), and securely store credentials for subsequent API calls.

## Strategy

### Implementation Options
1. **Direct OAuth Flow with FastAPI**
   - Implement the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow directly in FastAPI.
   - Handle redirect, callback, and token exchange endpoints.
   - Store access and refresh tokens securely in MongoDB (encrypted).
   - Use background jobs for token refresh.
   - Pros: Full control, easy to extend, minimal dependencies.
   - Cons: Slightly more code to maintain.

2. **Use OAuth Library (e.g., Authlib)**
   - Leverage Authlib or similar for OAuth flow abstraction.
   - Reduces boilerplate and potential security pitfalls.
   - Pros: Faster to implement, less error-prone.
   - Cons: Adds dependency, less control over edge cases.

3. **Third-Party Auth Service (Not Recommended for Pre-MVP)**
   - Use Auth0 or similar to manage OAuth.
   - Pros: Offloads security, easy scaling.
   - Cons: Overkill for Pre-MVP, adds cost and complexity.

### Recommended MVP Approach
- **Option 1 or 2**: Implement OAuth 2.0 flow directly in FastAPI, optionally using Authlib for simplicity.
- Store tokens encrypted in MongoDB.
- Implement endpoints for login, callback, token refresh, and user profile fetch.
- Ensure all sensitive data is handled securely.
- Add background job for token refresh if needed.

## Executive Checklist
- [ ] Register Strava application and obtain client credentials
- [ ] Implement `/api/auth/strava/authorize` endpoint (redirect to Strava)
- [ ] Implement `/api/auth/strava/callback` endpoint (handle code exchange)
- [ ] Securely store access and refresh tokens in MongoDB (encrypted)
- [ ] Implement `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint for token refresh
- [ ] Implement `/api/auth/user` endpoint to fetch user profile
- [ ] Add JWT-based session management for API access
- [ ] Enforce HTTPS and secure cookie/session handling
- [ ] Document the authentication flow for frontend integration
