# Data Modeling & Storage - Backend-AI Planning

## Introduction
Robust data modeling and storage are foundational for StravaAIâ€™s backend and AI capabilities. The system must efficiently store user profiles, activities, and AI-generated insights in MongoDB, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and compatibility with analytics and AI modules. Well-designed schemas enable fast queries, flexible analytics, and seamless AI integration.

## Strategy

### Implementation Options
1. **Direct Mapping from Strava Data**
   - Store Strava API responses with minimal transformation.
   - Pros: Fast to implement, ensures all data is available.
   - Cons: May include unnecessary fields, less optimized for queries.

2. **Normalized Custom Schemas (Recommended for Pre-MVP)**
   - Design custom MongoDB schemas for users, activities, and insights, based on technical spec.
   - Store only relevant fields, but keep a raw_data field for the full Strava response.
   - Pros: Optimized for queries, flexible for analytics/AI, future-proof.
   - Cons: Requires initial schema design.

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Store essential fields in top-level schema, keep full Strava response in a nested field.
   - Pros: Best of both worlds, but can increase storage size.

### Recommended MVP Approach
- Use normalized custom schemas for `users`, `activities`, and `insights` collections as defined in the technical specification.
- Store all essential fields for analytics and AI, plus a `raw_data` field for the full Strava response.
- Use MongoDB indexes on frequently queried fields (user_id, activity_id, dates).
- Encrypt sensitive fields (tokens, PII).
- Document schema for frontend and AI integration.

## Executive Checklist
- [ ] Finalize MongoDB schemas for `users`, `activities`, and `insights` (per technical spec)
- [ ] Implement schema validation (e.g., Pydantic models in FastAPI)
- [ ] Add indexes for performance-critical fields
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive fields (tokens, PII)
- [ ] Store full Strava response in `raw_data` field
- [ ] Document schema for frontend and AI teams
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with analytics and AI modules
