# Analytics API - Backend-AI Planning

## Introduction
The Analytics API is responsible for delivering real-time metrics, trends, and milestone progress to users via the dashboard. It aggregates and analyzes activity data, providing actionable insights and visualizations that power both the frontend dashboard and AI modules. The API must be performant, flexible, and designed to support future AI-driven analytics.

## Strategy

### Implementation Options
1. **Direct Aggregation in API Endpoints**
   - Perform data aggregation and analytics directly in FastAPI endpoints using MongoDB aggregation pipelines.
   - Pros: Simple, fast to implement, leverages MongoDBâ€™s strengths.
   - Cons: May become complex for advanced analytics.

2. **Precomputed Analytics (Background Jobs)**
   - Use background jobs to periodically compute and cache analytics results in MongoDB.
   - Pros: Fast API responses, offloads heavy computation.
   - Cons: Slightly more complex, risk of stale data.

3. **Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Pre-MVP)**
   - Use direct aggregation for simple metrics and trends, and precompute/cached results for heavier analytics (e.g., milestone progress).
   - Pros: Balances performance and freshness, MVP-friendly.
   - Cons: Requires some coordination between API and background jobs.

### Recommended MVP Approach
- Implement core analytics endpoints using MongoDB aggregation pipelines for real-time metrics and trends.
- For heavier analytics (e.g., milestone progress), consider precomputing results with background jobs and caching them.
- Design endpoints to be flexible for future AI-driven analytics (e.g., allow filtering by sport_type, time period).
- Ensure API responses are structured for easy frontend and AI consumption.

## Executive Checklist
- [ ] Implement `/api/analytics/dashboard` endpoint (summary, trends, milestones)
- [ ] Implement `/api/analytics/trends` endpoint (trend analysis by metric, sport_type, period)
- [ ] Implement `/api/analytics/milestones` endpoint (milestone progress)
- [ ] Use MongoDB aggregation pipelines for real-time analytics
- [ ] Set up background jobs for precomputing heavy analytics (if needed)
- [ ] Structure API responses for frontend and AI modules
- [ ] Document API endpoints and response formats
