# StravaAI Pre-MVP - Executive Summary

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Build an AI-powered activity insight dashboard integrating with Strava OAuth to provide personalized performance analytics for endurance sports enthusiasts.

**Timeline**: 5 weeks for Pre-MVP completion
**Team**: 2-3 developers
**Budget**: ~$500/month for infrastructure and AI API costs

## Key Strategic Decisions

### 1. Architecture Choice: Monolithic FastAPI (RECOMMENDED)
- **Rationale**: Faster development, easier testing, sufficient scalability for Pre-MVP
- **Alternative Considered**: Microservices (over-engineered for Pre-MVP)
- **Technology Stack**: FastAPI + MongoDB + React/Next.js + Docker

### 2. Core Features Prioritization
1. **Authentication**: Strava OAuth integration
2. **Data Processing**: Latest activity + 1-month history
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and trends
4. **AI Insights**: OpenAI/Gemini-powered coaching
5. **Milestone Tracking**: Goal-oriented progress monitoring

### 3. AI Strategy
- **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-4o or Gemini 2.5 Lite
- **Focus**: Context-aware analysis with personalized recommendations
- **Cost Control**: Usage monitoring and fallback responses

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Python 3.11+ and Node.js 18+
- [ ] Set up Docker and MongoDB
- [ ] Configure development IDE
- [ ] Create project structure

### Strava Integration
- [ ] Register application with Strava API
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 flow
- [ ] Set up token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Create user onboarding flow

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
- **Strava API Limits**: Implement caching and exponential backoff
- **AI API Costs**: Monitor usage and set up fallbacks
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and implement caching

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Focus on core value proposition
- **Competition**: Emphasize AI-powered insights as differentiator

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- < 1% error rate

### Business
- User onboarding completion rate > 80%
- Daily active users
- Insight engagement rate

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Backend Developer (FastAPI, MongoDB)
- 1 Frontend Developer (React, Next.js)
- 1 Full-stack Developer (DevOps, Testing)

### Infrastructure
- MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)
- Docker for containerization
- VPS/Cloud hosting for deployment
- OpenAI/Gemini API for AI insights

## Timeline Breakdown

| Week | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Environment & Auth | Project setup, OAuth integration |
| 2 | Data Processing | Activity fetching, data models |
| 3 | Analytics Dashboard | Metrics display, charts |
| 4 | AI Integration | Insight generation, recommendations |
| 5 | Testing & Deployment | Production deployment, documentation |

## Budget Breakdown

### Monthly Costs (Post-Launch)
- **Infrastructure**: $100-200 (VPS, MongoDB Atlas)
- **AI API**: $200-300 (OpenAI/Gemini usage)
- **Monitoring**: $50 (logging, analytics)
- **Total**: ~$500/month

## Stakeholder Communication Plan

### Weekly Updates
- Progress against timeline
- Technical challenges and solutions
- User feedback and metrics
- Budget tracking

### Milestone Reviews
- Week 2: Authentication and data integration
- Week 3: Analytics dashboard completion
- Week 4: AI insights integration
- Week 5: Production deployment

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### Week 2 Checkpoint
- Strava OAuth working
- Basic data fetching functional
- User onboarding complete

### Week 4 Checkpoint
- Analytics dashboard functional
- AI insights generating
- Performance metrics acceptable

## Conclusion

The StravaAI Pre-MVP project is well-positioned for success with a clear technical strategy, realistic timeline, and comprehensive risk mitigation plan. The monolithic FastAPI approach provides the optimal balance of development speed and maintainability for the Pre-MVP phase.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation following the outlined timeline and strategy.
