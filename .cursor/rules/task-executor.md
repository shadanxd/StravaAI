## VERY CRITICAL & IMPORTANT

We are building a MVP and we dont want to write too much code. You MUST act with MVP as the focus.

You may recieve a plan document with an executive checklist. 

You MUST follow the following guidelines:-

-   **Context Building** - 
    -   Review any files that are required and relevant.
    -   In case you recieve the plan document, you must examine the plan in detail with a MVP focus.
    -   In case you dont recieve a plan document, you have to examine the users requirement with a MVP focus.
    -   Keep ```./requriements/``` in memory to have the overall picture of what you're building

-   **Setup Project** - If project is not setup, setup project files and python environment, make sure you update requirements.txt before installing packages.

-   **Tests** - Maintain 85%+ test coverage

-   **Credentials** - All credentials are added in .env for Strava API, Third part API integration and Mongo Connection is added if missing anything point that out before executing a task


-   **Checklist** - Update the task to-do list.
    -   In case a to-do list is not present, you have to create a to-do list based on the plan or the users requirement.
    -   In case the task to-do list is present, you have to update the to-do list with the results.

-   **Execution** - Execute the task to-do list keeping the MVP focus. Dont STOP  working on the checklist unless absolutely required.
